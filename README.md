# COSC343-Labs
## Lab 2 - Uninformed and informed search
A* search AI uses the number of misplaced tiles and the manhatten distance in order to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

## Lab 3 - Adversarial search
AI uses the minimax algorithm in order to win a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Lab 5 - Genetic Algorithm
AI uses a genetic algorithm in order to solve the 8 queen problem.

## Lab 6 - Naive Bayes classifier and machine learning
Use numpy and Matplotlib to plot and view Naive Bayes classifier.

## Lab 7 - Classification and the Perceptron
Use numpy and Matplotlib to plot and view Classification and the Perceptron problems.

## Lab 8 - Steepest Gradient Descent
Use numpy and Matplotlib to plot and view Linear regression and least squares (LS). Implement the SGD algorithm for polynomial regression & classification.

## Lab 10 - Multilayer perceptron
Practice with solving regression and classification machine learning problems using the MLP model.

## Lab 11 - Simple Recurrent Network (SRN)
Train a text-predicting/generating recurrent neural network. Implement a simple text-predictor/generator.
